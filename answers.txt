What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge and rebase accomplish the same task but in different ways.  They both merge two branches. Merge combines the branches by creating a new commit in the target branch, while rebase does it by rewriting the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.
